# array-of-products

ALGO EXPERT MEDIUM

write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers and returns an array
the same length, where each element in the output array is equal to the product
of every other number in the input array.

Not that you're expected to solve this problem without using division.

Sample input: array = [5, 1, 4, 2]<br>
Sample output: [8, 40, 10, 20]<br>
